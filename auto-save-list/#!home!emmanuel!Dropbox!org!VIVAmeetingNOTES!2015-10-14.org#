* No-reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA)

** Global approach

*** Use global statistic features in concert with  models to determine quality

** Local approach

*** Use an "image content index" as local features

    -- Determine quality among each local region

* Texture Compensation

** Intuition -> complex structure is sensitive to blurring, flat structure is sensitive to noise.
